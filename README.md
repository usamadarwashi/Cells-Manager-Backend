# FullStackChallenge
Full-Application using Angular and Spring boot.

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application that leverages the Spring framework on the backend to interact with a telecom company's API endpoint. The application is designed to filter and manipulate the incoming data based on user input, ultimately presenting the refined information in JSON format. On the frontend, Angular is employed to interface with the APIs, enabling the presentation of this data through a user-friendly table and interactive chart visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- *Angular [Version 16.2.1]:* Angular is a popular open-source framework for building web applications. It provides a structured way to create dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces for your web application.

- *Spring Boot [Version 3.13]:* Spring Boot is a framework for building Java-based applications with ease. It simplifies the development of robust and scalable back-end services.

## Dependencies Used
- *Spring Web:* Spring Web is a part of the Spring Framework that provides features for building web applications, including RESTful APIs and web controllers.

- *Spring Data JPA:* Spring Data JPA simplifies data access with JPA (Java Persistence API). It provides easy and efficient access to relational databases.

- *MySQL Driver:* The MySQL Driver allows your Spring Boot application to connect and interact with MySQL databases efficiently.

### Prerequisites
- Front-End Folder: Download Node.js to install Angular CLI, open Node.js and type: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Back-End Folder: Open Spring Initializer in the web, download the folder
- Download Java (Jdk and Jre)
- Download MySQL
- Download VS Code Software
- Download Intelliej Software
- Download Postman or HTTPei for API Testing

### Getting Started

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Open the two folders: celltowermanagerapp with Visual Studio and celltowermanager with IntellieJ.
- Change the files directories to match thier new location on your system.
- Use this api to get the JSON data: https://byanat.wiremockapi.cloud/api/v3/towers .
- ensure having a database and change the datasource configurations from application.properties.
- create a table in the database and feed the json data to the database using postman or httpie.
- Run the back-End
- Run the Front-End
- Open the web App.
